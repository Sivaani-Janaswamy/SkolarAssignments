            <h2>The Indian Ocean : <i class="Imp">third-largest of the world's five oceanic division</i></h2>
            <p>The Indian Ocean is a large saline water body covering about 20% of the world’s ocean total area. The ocean is the youngest geologically and the smallest of the three major oceans (Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans), but larger than the Arctic and Southern Oceans. It is located between Africa on the west, Asia on the north, Australia on the east, and south by the Southern Ocean.<br><br></p>
            <p>The Indian Ocean covers about 70.56 million square miles or 19.8% of the Earth’s total water surface. It has a maximum length of 10,000 kilometers, between Antarctica and the Bay of Bengal, and is 7,600 kilometers wide between Australia and Africa’s southern tip. Its average depth is 3,741 meters below the sea surface, with a maximum depth of 7,258 meters at the Sunda Deep in Java Trench, off Indonesia’s southern coast. The Ocean’s volume is 264 million cubic kilometers, while the coastline is approximately 66,526 kilometers.<br><br></p>
            <p>Nine of the 36 world’s biodiversity hotspots are in the Indian Ocean. Madagascar and neighboring islands host 13,000 plants, 381 reptiles, 313 birds, 160 fish, and 200 mammals, of which the majority are endemic species. The Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot contains over 8,000 plants, 197 mammals, 200 reptiles, and 70 freshwater fishes. The Eastern Africa coastal forests are home to over 4,000 plants (1,750 endemics) and 235 mammals. The Horn of Africa, including the East Africa Rift Valley and Ethiopian Highlands, hosts over 5,000 plants, 100 freshwater fishes, and close to 190 mammals. The other biodiversity hotspots around the Indian Ocean region are Western Ghats-Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma, Sundaland, Wallacea, and Southwest Australia. Sundaland hosts over 25,000 plant species, including 15,000 endemic species.</p>
